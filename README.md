Microblogging support for MarkPub and MassiveWiki websites
=========================

Script to (1) post a link to a MarkPub or MassiveWiki website to Bluesky,
and (2) display any comments and likes made to that Bluesky post.  

To run this Python script, you need the 'requests' and 'bs4' (BeautifulSoup) packages installed. Tested with Python 3.12.

This code is an excerpt of the code described in the blog post ["Posting via the Bluesky API"](https://atproto.com/blog/create-post).

To install:

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  


For a list of options and arguments:

```shell
markpub-bskypost
```
